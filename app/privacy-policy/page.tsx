              <p className="mb-4">
                Cheyf Accommodations uses so-called social plugins (‘buttons’) of social networks such as Facebook, Google+ and Twitter.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                When you visit our websites these buttons are activated by default, i.e. without your intervention they can send data to the respective social networks. The social network can retrieve data, independently of whether you interact with the button or not. If you are logged on to a social network, the network can assign your visit to the website to your user account. A social network cannot assign a visit to other Cheif d.o.o. websites unless and until you activate the respective button there as well.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                If you are a member of a social network and do not wish it to combine data retrieved from your visit to our websites with your membership data, you must log out from the social network before visiting our website or finde adecvate settings in your social network site.
              </p>
              <p>
                We have no influence on the scope of data that is collected by the social networks through their buttons. The data use policies of the social networks provide information on the purpose and extent of the data that they collect, how this data is processed and used, the rights available to you and the settings that you can use to protect your privacy.
